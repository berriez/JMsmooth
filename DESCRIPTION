Title: Survival models for longitudinal data with a Smooth Random Effects Distributions
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Berrie Zielman

Description: The smoothLME package implements methods for mixed models of longitudinal data. 
             Longitudinal data, where data are recorded on a series of time points are often collected in
             medicine, biology, pharmacokinetics and other fields. The mixed effects model incorporate both fixed effects and random effects. 
             Usually, the random effects in a linear mixed model are drawn from a normal distribution, whereas more advanced models utilize a mixture distribution for the random effects<doi:10.1080/01621459.1996.10476679>. 
             This package estimates a skewed distribution for the random effects, by imposing constraints on the component means and the probabilities of the mixture. 
             The model contains the linear mixed model with a normal distribution for the random effects as a special case when the estimated distances between the means are zero.
